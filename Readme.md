# goreleaser-example

![goreleaser](https://github.com/4thel00z/goreleaser-example/workflows/goreleaser/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Motivation

I want to have a brain dump of how to use goreleaser for my golang projects.
I like to use code to document tools rather read through 1201 pages of documentation.

## Solution

Create a small boilerplate project with github actions and a goreleaser configuration
which builds all specified releases based on a certain trigger (currently it builds
for all tags) which is specified in the github action.
